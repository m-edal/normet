\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing the input data.}

\item{model}{Pre-trained model for decomposition. If not provided, a model will be trained.}

\item{value}{The target variable name as a string.}

\item{feature_names}{The names of the features used for training and decomposition.}

\item{split_method}{The method for splitting data into training and testing sets. Default is 'random'.}

\item{fraction}{The proportion of the data to be used for training. Default is 0.75.}

\item{model_config}{A list containing configuration parameters for model training.}

\item{n_samples}{Number of samples to generate for normalization. Default is 300.}

\item{seed}{A random seed for reproducibility. Default is 7654321.}

\item{importance_ascending}{Logical indicating whether to sort feature importances in ascending order. Default is FALSE.}

\item{n_cores}{Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing. Default is system's total minus one.}

\item{verbose}{Should the function print progress messages? Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing the decomposed data frame and model statistics.
}
\description{
