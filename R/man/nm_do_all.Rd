\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing the input data.}

\item{model}{Pre-trained model for normalisation. If not provided, a model will be trained.}

\item{value}{The target variable name as a string.}

\item{feature_names}{The names of the features used for training and normalisation.}

\item{variables_resample}{The names of the variables to be resampled for normalisation. Default is NULL (all feature names except date_unix).}

\item{split_method}{The method for splitting data into training and testing sets. Default is 'random'.}

\item{fraction}{The proportion of the data to be used for training. Default is 0.75.}

\item{model_config}{A list containing configuration parameters for model training.}

\item{n_samples}{Number of samples to generate for normalisation. Default is 300.}

\item{seed}{A random seed for reproducibility. Default is 7654321.}

\item{n_cores}{Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing. Default is system's total minus one.}

\item{aggregate}{Logical indicating whether to aggregate the results. Default is TRUE.}

\item{weather_df}{Optional data frame containing weather data for resampling.}

\item{verbose}{Should the function print progress messages? Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing the normalised data frame and model statistics.
}
\description{
\code{nm_do_all} performs the entire process of training a model, normalising the data, and collecting model statistics.
